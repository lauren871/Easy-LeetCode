Hashmap:

<i>num_map</i> : initializes empty dictionary that stores number as key and its index as value
- Key = number from the list
- Value = index of that number

<i>enumerate(nums)</i> : gives both index i and value num at each step

<i>num_map[num] = i</i> : stores current number and it's index in hashmap
